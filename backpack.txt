Install Backpack\Base
1) Run in your terminal:

cd yourprojectname
composer require backpack/base
2) Add the service providers in config/app.php, at the end of the providers array:

/*
* Backpack Service Providers...
*/
Backpack\Base\BaseServiceProvider::class,
3) Then run a few commands in the terminal:

php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Backpack\Base\BaseServiceProvider" #publishes configs, langs, views and AdminLTE files
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Prologue\Alerts\AlertsServiceProvider" # publish config for notifications - prologue/alerts
php artisan migrate #generates users table (using Laravel's default migrations)

4) Make sure the reset password emails have the correct reset link by adding these to your User model:

before class name:
use Backpack\Base\app\Notifications\ResetPasswordNotification as ResetPasswordNotification;
as a method inside the User class:
    /**
     * Send the password reset notification.
     *
     * @param  string  $token
     * @return void
     */
    public function sendPasswordResetNotification($token)
    {
        $this->notify(new ResetPasswordNotification($token));
    }
5) [optional] Backpack comes with a generators package that helps you create models, controllers, requests, etc from the command line. laracasts/generators is an awesome package you can use to generate migrations. Install them only if you want (for your local environment only - that's why the --dev flag). But using them can greatly improve your speed:

composer require backpack/generators --dev
composer require laracasts/generators --dev
laracasts/generators compatibility with Laravel 5.4
As of 03 Feb 2017, laracasts/generators is not officially compatible with L5.4. We have submitted the fixes, they've been merged, they work perfectly, but they haven't been officially published. For now, you can install laracasts/generators on L5.4 by:
1) manually specifying this in your composer.json file, in the require-dev section:
        "laracasts/generators": "dev-master as 1.1.4",
2) then running composer update
6) [optional] Change values in config/backpack/base.php to make the admin panel your own. Backpack is white label, so you can change everything: menu color, project name, developer name etc.

7) [optional] If your application only has one login screen (for the admins), that means you're not going to use the auth controllers that Laravel provided by default. You're only going to use Backpack's auth controllers. You can keep the Laravel ones in your project, of course. But some people like to delete them to not get confused later on:

# OPTIONAL! Please read the notice above.
rm -rf app/Http/Controllers/Auth #deletes laravel's demo auth controllers

Install Backpack\CRUD
1) In your terminal:

composer require backpack/crud
2) Add this provider to your config/app.php, after "base":

        Backpack\CRUD\CrudServiceProvider::class,
3) Run these command in this exact order:

php artisan elfinder:publish #published elfinder assets
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Backpack\CRUD\CrudServiceProvider" --tag="public" #publish CRUD assets
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Backpack\CRUD\CrudServiceProvider" --tag="lang" #publish CRUD lang files
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Backpack\CRUD\CrudServiceProvider" --tag="config" #publish CRUD and custom elfinder config files
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Backpack\CRUD\CrudServiceProvider" --tag="elfinder" #publish custom elFinder views
4) Define an 'uploads' disk. In your config/filesystems.php add this disk:

'uploads' => [
            'driver' => 'local',
            'root' => public_path('uploads'),
        ],
5) Create "uploads" folder in your public folder.

6) [Optional] You can now add the file manager to the menu, in resources/views/vendor/backpack/base/inc/sidebar.blade.php or menu.blade.php:

<li><a href="{{ url(config('backpack.base.route_prefix', 'admin') . '/elfinder') }}"><i class="fa fa-files-o"></i> <span>File manager</span></a></li>
---- OPTIONALS ----
Everything else is optional. Your project might use them or it might not. Only do each following step if you need the functionality that package provides.
